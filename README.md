Friday. You ended by working on the regex for checking name field. It is borked. learn about js regex.

Monday. Regex char check works. Altered name check to give specific errors rather than generic 'something is wrong'.


Things to do:
Program Arduino to send messages formatted in the spec that CAN-BUS-TOOL uses so I can test this without having to connect to my car.

When message has changed, highlight changed byte in Change column.

When message with same id has been received, increment Message count column.
